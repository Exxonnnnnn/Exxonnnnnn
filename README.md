## Hello ðŸ‘‹
### One day I'll be able to call myself a developer. Until then, I will continue to attempt to code (mainly Discord bots).

### [CDColours](https://npmjs.com/cdcolours)
Make your console colourful! Yes it is spelt "Colours" not "Colors" because UK is a vibe. [View it on NPM](https://npmjs.com/cdcolours)

- Support for both TypeScript and JavaScript
- Works with Portugese and English
- Big updates coming soon ðŸ‘€

### [CDTickets](https://npmjs.com/cdtickets)
An easy to use tickets package for Discord.js bots.   
**NOTE** - This package is going to be completely re done and will have support for MongoDB in v2, there may be some issues with the current version. If you are using [CDCommands](https://npmjs.com/cdcommands) as your handler I would not recommend using CDTickets as we will be adding tickets to CDCommands in one of the next major updates.

### [Discord Rick Roll](https://npmjs.com/discord-rick-roll)
This is basically just a meme package that returns with rick rolls for everything. If you are looking for a serious package please do not use this.   
If you want to be added to the package just open a [pull request](https://github.com/Exxonnnnnn/discord-rick-roll).
